**Finder Unclutter** does the following all at once:

- **Unminimize** all Finder windows
- **Unduplicate** all Finder tabs
- **Merge** all Finder windows and tabs
- **Organize** Finder in a single/dual pane layout
- **Position** Finder in a specified area of the desktop

## Requirements

- [Alfred 5](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with Powerpack

This workflow has been developed and tested on macOS Sonoma and macOS Tahoe.

## Installation

To install, download [Finder Unclutter Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/yohasebe/finder-unclutter/raw/main/finder-unclutter.alfredworkflow) (version 1.7)

## Change Log

- 1.7 (2025-09-22)
  - Center horizontal dual-pane layout now balances both panes by offsetting the left pane with the measured Finder sidebar width.
  - Smart Folder tabs are preserved while transient search results remain excluded when windows are rebuilt.
- 0.1.6 (2025-02-04)
  - Show Desktop menu item added

## Setting up

This Workflow only functions properly if the language setting of Finder.app is set to **English** due to the way it interacts with Finder's interface.

When this Workflow is launched, if the language of Finder.app is not English (`en`), a dialog will be displayed. Clicking OK will automatically change the language setting of Finder.app to English.

If you want to revert the language setting of Finder back to its original state, you can do so in macOS's `System Settings` under `Language & Region` / `Applications`. A system restart may be required after changing these settings. Alternatively, you can revert it by executing the following command. Please specify `LANG_CODE` in the [ISO 639-1](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html) format as appropriate.

```
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleLanguages '("LANG_CODE")'; killall Finder
```

## macOS Permissions

On first run macOS prompts for automation access. Approve the dialogs for **Alfred** so it can control **Finder** and **System Events**. If the prompts were dismissed, open `System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security` and enable:

- `Accessibility`: allow Alfred to control the computer.
- `Automation`: under Alfred, check Finder and System Events.

The workflow writes to `com.apple.Finder AppleLanguages` when switching Finder to English and automatically restarts Finder via `killall Finder`.

## Troubleshooting

- Finder still opens in the previous language: rerun the workflow and accept the language change, or manually set Finder to English in `System Settings ‚Üí Language & Region ‚Üí Applications`.
- Windows do not merge completely: increase `wait_in_seconds` in the workflow configuration so Finder has more time to reopen slow network or external volumes before merging.
- Automation prompts reappear or automation steps fail: recheck Alfred under `Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility` and `Automation`, then restart Alfred and Finder.

## Features

Each feature can be assigned a unique hotkey for quick access.

#### <img src="./icons/mini-dual-pane.png" width=32> Unclutter ‚Üí Dual-Pane

Organizes Finder tabs/windows into a double-pane Finder window. All existing tabs are collected in the primary pane.

The secondary pane will contain only one tab that displays the user-specified contents (`same as primary`, `parent`, `desktop`, or `home`).

The dual Finder pane can be placed in either `center (horizontal)`, `center (vertical)`, `fill (horizontal)`, `fill (vertical)`, `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`. You can either specify the area either by using hotkeys, or by selecting one on running the workflow.

#### <img src="./icons/mini-single-pane.png" width=32> Unclutter ‚Üí Single-Pane

Finder tabs/windows will be organized into a single Finder window. All existing tabs will be collected in this Finder window.

The dual Finder pane can be placed in either `center`, `fill`, `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`. You can either specify the area either by using hotkeys, or by selecting one on running the workflow.

#### <img src="./icons/mini-toggle.png" width=32> Toggle Show/Hide Finder Windows

This feature relies on Alfreds `toggle visibility` feature.

#### <img src="./icons/mini-close-other.png" width=32> Close Other Tabs and Windows

This will close all the non-current Finder tabs and windows.

#### <img src="./icons/mini-close-all.png" width=32> Close All Finder Windows

This will close all the Finder tabs and windows including the current one. A confirmation dialog pops up.

#### <img src="./icons/show-desktop.png" width=32> Show Desktop

Show Desktop using Mission Control's "Show Desktop" feature. Use the `show_desktop_keycode` environment variable if you want to change the default key code (`103`).

#### <img src="./icons/mini-finder-unclutter.png" width=32> Open Config

For details on each of the configurable parameters, see [below](#configuration).

## Configuration

#### Sidebar Width

Setting the Sidebar Width to 0 will hide the sidebar. Otherwise, this value is set as the width of the sidebar (`0-500`, default = `200`).

#### Sidebars in horizontal dual pane mode

If set to `single`, the sidebar is shown only in the left-hand side Finder window (default = single).

#### Home folder path

Specifies the UNIX path of a new folder to open when no Finder window is present (default = `~`).

#### View type in primary pane

The finder view type used on the primary pane (`list`, `icon`, `column`, or `gallery`, default = `list`).


#### View type of secondary pane

The finder view type used on the secondary pane (`list`, `icon`, `column`, or `gallery`, default = `list`).

#### Contents on secondary pane

The contents presented on the secondary pane (`same as primary`, `home`, `parent`,  `desktop`, default = `parent`)

#### Wait message

If checked, "uncluttering" message is shown before single/dual pane Finder window appears (default = `checked`).

#### Hide other apps

If checked, other apps will be hidden while the single/dual Finder pane gets displayed (default = `unchecked`).

#### Reverse panes

Reverse the contents of the primary (left/top) and secondary (right/bottom) panes in the dual pane mode (default = `unchecked`).

## Environment Variables

- `show_desktop_keycode`: The keycode of the key assigned to Mission Control's "Show Desktop" (default = `103`).
- `wait_in_seconds`: The number of seconds to wait before each Finder window operation is executed (default = `0.5`).
